                        I have just started my journey as a bootcamp student. I am excited to learn new things and meet
                        new
                        people. I am looking forward to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

                            Today was my first day at the bootcamp. I met my classmates and instructors. We had an
                            orientation
                            and got to know each other. I am excited to start learning and working on projects.

                            Today we delved deeper into JavaScript. We learned about variables, functions, and loops. It
                            was
                            challenging but very rewarding. I am eager to practice more and build interactive web
                            applications.
